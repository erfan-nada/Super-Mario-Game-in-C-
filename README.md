# Super Mario Game in C#

A 2D Super Mario-style platformer game developed in C# as part of an academic project at MSA University.

## 🎮 Overview

This project is a clone of the classic Super Mario game, featuring core gameplay mechanics such as:
- Player movement and jumping
- Enemy collision
- Score and time tracking
- Game levels and obstacles
- Animated sprites and background scrolling

The game includes **3 exciting levels**, each with increasing difficulty and unlockable features:
- **Level 1:** Complete this level to unlock **single bullets**. Press the **`X`** key to shoot.
- **Level 2:** Complete this level to unlock **multiple bullets**. Press the **`B`** key to shoot in bursts.
- **Level 3:** Final challenge with full player abilities unlocked.

The game was developed using **Windows Forms** in **C# (.NET Framework)** and is designed to be lightweight, responsive, and visually reminiscent of the original Mario experience.
